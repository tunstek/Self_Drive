### NOTE

This is a simple (very primitive) game written in python that I hope to connect to my NEAT neural network implementation when it is finished

It can still be played with manually for now

### Setup

run 'python selfdrive.py' to play the game
 - use w, a, s, d for controls

run 'python mapcreate.py' to change the map


output in console is the current fitness
